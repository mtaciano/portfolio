    <p>
      Hello! I'm a computer engineer who recently received my bachelor's degree
      from
      <a target="_blank" href={unifesp}>Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo</a>,
      in Brazil. I'm interested in all computer-related fields, such as web
      development, security and cryptography, language design, embedded systems
      and more. My current most-used languages are C, Python and Rust.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my time at the university, my most researched fields were Machine
      learning (mainly Reinforcement Learning) and Computer Vision. In that
      period, I developed a <a target="_blank" href={jigsaw}
        >Jigsaw Puzzle Solver</a
      > that used Semantic Segmentation and Machine Learning to solve jigsaw puzzles
      (visual puzzles).
    </p>

    <p>
      My other big project was the development of a <a
        target="_blank"
        href={risc}>32-bit RISC CPU</a
      >
      using FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and Verilog, for which I also
      developed an <a target="_blank" href={cminus}>accompanying compiler</a>
      based on a small subset of the C programming language. My current side project
      is a
      <a target="_blank" href={sol}>complete rewrite</a> of it, with better code,
      more features and fewer bugs!
    </p>
